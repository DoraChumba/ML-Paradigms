## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Cancer is one of the leading global health challenges. Early detection of Cervical cancer risk can significantly improve patient outcomes.
This project uses **machine learning** techniques to analyze patient health data and predict whether a patient is at risk of cancer.

The notebook includes:

* Data preprocessing (cleaning, imputing missing values, encoding).
* Feature selection (excluding target-leakage features like screening test results).
* Training multiple machine learning classifiers.
* Comparing performance with confusion matrices, ROC curves, and cross-validation.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset includes patient health and lifestyle attributes such as:

* **Demographics:** Age, Gender.
* **Health Factors:** Smoking, Alcohol intake, Obesity, Diet.
* **Screening Results:** Cancer test outcomes (removed to prevent leakage).
* **Target Variable:** Whether the patient is at risk of cancer (`Cancer` = 0 or 1).

ðŸ‘‰ **Note:** The dataset used in this project was provided for coursework and may not be publicly available.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* **Libraries:**

  * `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ data handling
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ visualization
  * `scikit-learn` â€“ ML models and evaluation
  * `imblearn` â€“ handling imbalanced datasets

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

   * Load dataset and inspect structure.
   * Check missing values, class balance, and distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values with `SimpleImputer`.
   * Encode categorical variables.
   * Drop features causing **data leakage** (e.g., direct cancer test results).
   * Split data into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)** sets with stratification.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   * Build ML pipelines for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
   * Use cross-validation for robust performance estimation.
   * Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

4. **Visualization**

   * Confusion matrices for classification errors.
   * ROC curves to compare model performance.
   * Feature importance plot (Random Forest).

## ðŸ¤– Models Implemented

1. **Logistic Regression** (with class balancing)
2. **Random Forest Classifier** (ensemble learning, feature importance)
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (with RBF kernel & probability outputs)

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to assess model performance:

* **Accuracy** â€“ Overall correctness.
* **Precision** â€“ Ability to correctly identify cancer-positive patients.
* **Recall (Sensitivity)** â€“ Ability to detect all actual cancer cases.
* **F1-score** â€“ Balance of precision and recall.
* **ROC-AUC** â€“ Area under the ROC curve (discrimination ability).

---

## âœ… Results

* **Random Forest** achieved the best balance of recall and precision.
* **Logistic Regression** performed consistently and explained feature contributions.
* **SVM** worked well after scaling, though slower on large datasets.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights:

* Lifestyle and health-related factors strongly influence cancer risk predictions.
* Handling **missing values** and preventing **data leakage** are critical for trustworthy results.
